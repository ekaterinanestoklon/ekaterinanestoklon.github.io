            <h1>Hi, I'm Ekaterina</h1>
            <p>
              I'm a math geek who thrives on solving equations and diving deep
              into formulas that most people would find impossible (but I find
              fascinating!). When I'm not working through algebraic expressions,
              I enjoy tackling puzzles, playing chess, and getting lost in the
              world of science, but also I like sport.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have a wonderful family. My husband is my partner-in-crime, and
              together we've got two amazing kids who keep me on my toes. I love
              teaching them the wonders of math and science, even though they
              occasionally outsmart me with their creative ideas!
            </p>
            <p>
              Whether it's solving a Rubik's Cube or coming up with new ways to
              trick my kids into doing their homework, I'm always up for a
              challenge. Life is one big equation, and I'm always ready to solve
              it â€” one puzzle at a time!
